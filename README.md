# Svelteflix

This is a Sveltekit application. I built this app to learn the basics of Svelte and Sveltekit. This is a movie search consuming the "[Movies DB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)" API. You can see the app running on [https://svelteflix.vercel.app/](https://svelteflix.vercel.app/). This is a mobile first app (fully responsive). Here you'll find many Svelte concepts like "routing", "configuring", and "dynamic routing", among others.
